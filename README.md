# Active Review Miner

Active learning is a machine learning paradigm that can be used to reduce the human effort involved in supervied learning.

## Motivation

We motivate the need for active learning via an example scenario, demonstrating that choosing the right training set can potentially enhance the review classification accuracy. Consider an app from google play store whose developers want to analyze it's reviews to identify the features requested by the app's users. They would like to employ an automated classifier to identify reviews corrosponding to feature requests.

## Getting Started

IN PROGRESS. (To be updated)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

IN PROGRESS. (To be updated)

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

IN PROGRESS. (To be updated)

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
